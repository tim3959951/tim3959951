## 🔹 About Me

I build **production-ready AI systems** using open-source LLMs, RAG pipelines, and optimised inference frameworks.  
My experience spans from real-time Q&A with LangChain to deploying edge models with TFLite and TensorRT, combining research-grade AI with practical deployment.  
**Passionate about building real-world LLM applications that are fast, explainable, and energy-efficient.**
